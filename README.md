# What is Framework?

A framework in the context of software development is a platform or foundation that provides a structured way to build and deploy applications. Frameworks come with pre-written code, guidelines, and best practices to streamline development processes and ensure consistency. They help developers avoid reinventing the wheel by offering reusable components and libraries.

# Key Features of Frameworks
Code Reusability: Frameworks provide reusable code modules that save time and effort.
Standardization: They enforce consistent coding practices, making the code more predictable and maintainable.
Efficiency: By handling common tasks, frameworks allow developers to focus on application-specific logic.
Security: Many frameworks come with built-in security features, reducing vulnerabilities.
Community Support: Popular frameworks have large communities, providing extensive resources, tutorials, and support.

# What is MVT

MVT in Django stands for Model-View-Template. The Model component defines the data structure and handles the database interaction, representing your application's data and business logic. The View is responsible for processing user requests, interacting with the model to retrieve or manipulate data, and returning a response, usually by rendering a template. The Template is the presentation layer that determines how data is displayed to the user, typically through HTML. This architectural pattern ensures a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and maintain the code for complex web applications.
