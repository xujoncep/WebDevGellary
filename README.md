# What is Framework?

A framework in the context of software development is a platform or foundation that provides a structured way to build and deploy applications. Frameworks come with pre-written code, guidelines, and best practices to streamline development processes and ensure consistency. They help developers avoid reinventing the wheel by offering reusable components and libraries.

Key Features of Frameworks
Code Reusability: Frameworks provide reusable code modules that save time and effort.
Standardization: They enforce consistent coding practices, making the code more predictable and maintainable.
Efficiency: By handling common tasks, frameworks allow developers to focus on application-specific logic.
Security: Many frameworks come with built-in security features, reducing vulnerabilities.
Community Support: Popular frameworks have large communities, providing extensive resources, tutorials, and support.
